Thank you for looking over our project! While the overall website functions are pretty straightforward, here are some instructions nevertheless:

1. Register/log in/change password - 
 These actions can all be performed using the buttons on the right side of the navbar. Pretty straightforward, although the MoYa is intended to be exclusive
 to Yale students/affiliates, and therefore requires a "@yale.edu" email on sign-up.

2. Upload a post - 
 Once logged in, you should see an "upload" button on the right side of the navbar. Upon clicking on it, you will be prompted to upload an image and provide
 a title. If the image already exists in the MoYa, or the title is not unique, you will not be able to post your art. Otherwise, hit "submit" and you
 should be redirected to your feed, where your post will be at the top!

3. View feed/view and comment on posts - 
 Upon login or after clicking the feed button in the navbar, you will be presented with the 10 most recent posts in the MoYa. If you want to view posts
 older than that, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and skip to the next page, which will then show 10 new posts, and so on. If you want to
 comment on a certain post, you can see the comment button (and a number next to it telling you how many comments the post has) next to each piece of art.
 If you click on the button, you will be redirected to that post's "page", and will be able to see any comments left by other users. You can also write and
 post your own comments.

4. View profile - 
 If a certain artist interests you, you can click on their username anywhere on the website to view their portfolio, which is a page containing all the artwork
 by that single artist. Alternatively, you can enter the artist's username in the "lookup" bar in the navbar. If the username you entered exists, you will
 be presented with their portfolio. Unfortunately you need to get the artist's username right perfectly, and the lookup function is case-sensitive.

5. Delete posts - 
 If you regret posting something, don't worry! You can delete any of your own posts, either directly from your profile (which can easily be accessed by
 clicking the "profile" button in the right side of the navbar) or from the post's comment section. Clicking the red "delete" button will delete the post
 and any comments attached to it.

Thank you for reading, and I hope you have fun testing out our website! We sure had fun making it.
